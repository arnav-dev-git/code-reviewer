Evaluate the review comment as a senior software engineer performing a strict but fair assessment.

Focus on the following:
- Whether the comment correctly identifies real issues in the given code
- Whether the technical reasoning is sound and free from false assumptions
- Whether the suggestions are specific, actionable, and practical
- Whether the explanation is clear, concise, and easy to understand
- Whether the comment would meaningfully help a developer improve the code

Scoring guidance:
- 9–10: Excellent, highly useful, and technically precise
- 7–8: Good and mostly correct, with minor gaps
- 5–6: Partially useful but vague, incomplete, or weakly justified
- 3–4: Largely unhelpful, generic, or poorly reasoned
- 1–2: Incorrect, misleading, or irrelevant

Be objective and conservative in scoring.
Do not reward verbosity.
Penalize generic advice, speculation, or comments that do not directly relate to the provided code.
